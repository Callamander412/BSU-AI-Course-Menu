The AI engineer successfully built a multi-page React application for Bemidji State University, providing AI course project tutorials. Initial development focused on a carousel-based homepage and placeholder tutorial pages, followed by iterative content integration and styling. Key challenges included clarifying user design preferences, handling Google Docs image blocking, and resolving minor CSS syntax errors. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving by re-requesting images, correcting CSS, and adapting to user feedback for a refined BSU-themed design. The entire application now features five interactive tutorial pages with comprehensive content, images, and progress tracking.

<product_requirements>
The user, a faculty member at Bemidji State University, requested a clean, polished, multi-page website for AI course students. The site must offer five distinct AI project options: The Bobblehead, Suno Music Generation, Video Generation, Emergent Portfolio Website, and Krita LORA training. Each option needs a dedicated page featuring in-depth tutorials with at least four images and paragraph-long text bodies. The user explicitly requested a professional, AI/tech-themed design using Bemidji State University's green and white colors. Navigation should be a fun, dynamic carousel where the active option is prominent, and users can scroll endlessly. Tutorial pages must feature collapsible steps with checkboxes for progress tracking, and images should be integrated effectively. The site is informational, requiring no backend for student progress or data storage. The AI engineer has successfully built and refined all five tutorial pages with interactive elements and the requested BSU theme.
